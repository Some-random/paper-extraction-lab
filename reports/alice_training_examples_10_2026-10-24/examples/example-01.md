Reference: Q43758. All listed substitutions and deletions use the one-based canonical wild-type coordinates, including the initial methionine. Tags, linkers and targeting fusions are excluded. The sequence is not the complete tagged assay construct.

Published variant identities:
APEX: substitutions K14D, W41F, E112K; deletions none.
APEX2: substitutions K14D, W41F, E112K, A134P; deletions none.

Supplied assay observations:
- With 1.4 mM guaiacol, the reported rate maximum occurs around 0.1 mM peroxide for APEX and 2.5 mM for APEX2; rates decrease above these ranges.
- With 0.5 mM guaiacol, the corresponding values are around 0.05 mM and 0.5 mM.

**Question:** Which interpretation best explains the variant difference across both substrate conditions?

**Choices:**

- **A.** Only the higher-guaiacol condition shows an APEX2 advantage; the lower-guaiacol condition gives the same inhibition threshold for both enzymes.
- **B.** Both substrate conditions show a higher peroxide-inhibition threshold for APEX2, with unchanged thresholds when guaiacol concentration changes.
- **C.** Both substrate conditions show a higher peroxide-inhibition threshold for APEX2, with the threshold also depending on guaiacol concentration.
- **D.** Both substrate conditions give the same peroxide-inhibition threshold for APEX and APEX2, despite different guaiacol concentrations.

## Answer

Choice C captures both the variant difference and the dependence on guaiacol concentration.

Use the peroxide concentration at the reported rate maximum as an approximate boundary above which activity declines:
- At 1.4 mM guaiacol, the maximum occurs around 0.1 mM peroxide for APEX versus 2.5 mM for APEX2: approximately a 25-fold higher peroxide concentration for APEX2.
- At 0.5 mM guaiacol, the corresponding values are 0.05 mM and 0.5 mM: approximately a 10-fold higher concentration for APEX2.

Thus, both substrate conditions show a higher apparent peroxide-inhibition threshold for APEX2. The threshold is also guaiacol-dependent: increasing guaiacol from 0.5 to 1.4 mM shifts the maximum from 0.05 to 0.1 mM peroxide for APEX and from 0.5 to 2.5 mM for APEX2, approximately twofold and fivefold increases, respectively.

Mechanistically, peroxide drives formation of oxidizing heme intermediates during peroxidase catalysis, while guaiacol supplies reducing equivalents for productive turnover. Excess peroxide can promote nonproductive states or oxidative inactivation. Changing the electron-donor concentration can alter the balance between productive turnover and these competing processes, so an apparent peroxide-inhibition threshold need not be substrate-independent. This is consistent with the observations without establishing their precise molecular cause.

The listed sequence difference is A134P added to the shared K14D/W41F/E112K background. The assay observations establish the kinetic distinction; alanine-to-proline substitution chemistry alone would not uniquely predict it.

A is excluded because APEX2 also has a higher threshold at lower guaiacol. B is excluded because the thresholds change with guaiacol concentration. D is excluded because the variants have different thresholds under both conditions.

**Final answer: C**

<summary>Sources, evidence checks and limitations</summary>

### Evidence check

Primary full-text Results and Figure 2E text support the condition-dependent peroxide comparisons. The precise molecular cause of the A134P effect remains an interpretation, rather than an experimentally established mechanism.

### Answer limitations

The reported rate maxima are approximate, condition-dependent markers, not formal inhibition constants. These observations do not distinguish reversible inhibition from oxidative inactivation, establish a structural mechanism for A134P, or show that APEX2 has a higher maximum rate. The canonical sequence provides coordinates, not the complete tagged assay construct.

Reference-sequence scope: Canonical wild-type backbone for reference coordinates only; not claimed to be the complete tagged assay construct.

- Correctly compares both guaiacol conditions and checks the approximate concentration ratios.
- Explains the peroxide/electron-donor balance without converting apparent rate maxima into formal inhibition constants or asserting an unmeasured structural mechanism.
- The assay evidence establishes the phenotype; the sequence supports the A134P background comparison.

### Revision 4 source-caption clarification

The UniProt sequence above is the wild-type soybean ascorbate-peroxidase reference backbone. It is a coordinate reference for the separately listed APEX/APEX2 variants, not the assayed engineered construct. Only this source caption was corrected; the question and generated answer are unchanged.
